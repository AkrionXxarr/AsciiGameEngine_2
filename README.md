# AsciiGameEngine_2
An attempt to design, from scratch, a 2010 project with current experiences and more generic concepts.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the idea with this project will be that alternating from a console-based design to something more modern, such as DirectX or OpenGL, wouldn't require everything to be redone anew.<br>
<br>
This project will involve much more pre-planning than most of my projects, hopefully for greater results.
