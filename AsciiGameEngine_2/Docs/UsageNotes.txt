Quite a bit of preplanning for this

[Usability -] User needs to make sure to call every parent virtual function in their inherited engine class.
[Usability -] Wasn't a way to make use of the render context to draw to an alternate buffer.
              This was fixed, though I'm unsure of the implementation.
[Usability +] Input system working rather well thus far.
[Usability -] Memory management of objects leaves some to be desired.
[Usability] Current situation where all Draw functions reference directly to the console buffer makes
            drawing specifically to a subsection of the buffer more difficult. Either that or my current
			logic with how I'm making use of the render context is flawed.

[Functionality +] As it stands the inherited engine system to hide away essential functions has worked well.
[Functionality -] Memory management with object manager not great.

[Note] All row/col buffer for loops could be optimized by pre-calculating the (row * width)

Very little preplanning for this

[Usability -] Object usage is way too dependant on arbitrary sequences (e.g. UI -must- be the last object in the update/draw chain)
